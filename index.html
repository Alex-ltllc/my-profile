				<h1>Hello, my name is Alexandre L. üë®‚Äçüéì</h1>

					I love working out, playing video games and most of all, listening to music. I also started coding with Le Wagon and I really appreciate it !</p>

					<h2>Working out üèã</h2> 

					

						I love working out during my free time. It is in my opinion the best way to escape from reality and it definitely provdided me self-confidence over time.
					<br>
					
						Here are my three favourite work out exercises:
							<ul class="one">
								<li>Leg extension : very useful to grow your quadriceps</li>
								<li>Lat Pull Down : to grow your back</li>
								<li>Chest Press : to build strong pectorals (and chest overall)</li>
							</ul>
						As you can see, working out is now something that is really important for me and that I'm really passionate about.

					<h2>Video Games üéÆ</h2> 

					

						I started playing video games when I was 10 years old with a PS4 my parents bought me for Christmas. Since then, I play around 20 hours per week, mainly with friends as it is very funny. 
					<br>
					
						My top 3 games of all time:
							<ol class="one">
								<li>League of Legends</li>
								<li>Fortnite</li>
								<li>Minecraft</li>
							</ol>
						Of course now that I follow Ieseg courses I have less time to play, but it is still a real pleasure to spend some time with friends online.

				<h2>Musicüéß</h2> 

				

					To my mind, music is essential to life; like I could'nt imagine a world without music. It makes you feel good and is the best way to boost your confidence. I'm always listening to music, everywhere and at any time. Music is simply necessary to live. 
				<br>
				
					My top artists / groups :
						<ol class="one">
							<li>Dinos</li>
							<li>PNL</li>
							<li>Ninho</li>
							<li>Juice Wrld</li>
							<li>Pop SMoke</li>
						</ol>
					One advice I would have for people who do not often listen to music is to try every kind of music. There are so much differences between every type depending on culture, location, etc. Just enjoy trying each of them.
